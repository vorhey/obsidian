- It's a high-level abstraction built on top of multithreading.
- Involves dividing work among multiple threads that run concurrently.
- Aims to maximize the use of multiple processor cores.
- Uses multithreading as a mechanism to achieve parallelism.
- Parallel programming should be used any time you have a fair amount of computation work that can be split up into independent chunks.
